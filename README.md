This project is still under development (in my spare time) and is for educational purposes only. 

Currently im targeting Unity version 2018.4 ([Official API](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/))

Some of the classes being looked into:

* [Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.html)
* [Game Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html)
* [Component](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.html)
* [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html)

In the near future I will add short writeups on how to locate interesting data & code samples on how to use it
